	<h2>Early Life & Journey College</h2><hr>

	<p>
		I was born in Rochester, NY and have lived here pretty much her whole life.The elementary school that I went to was expeditionary learning based, which I think helped me to value practical and hands-on education from a young age. My high school was fortunate enough to have arts based majors for the students, and there I studied Theater Technology, which continued the same opportunities of physical learning. Included in that were some classes for lighting and sound design, CAD programming, and PhotoShop skills. I think these experiences have all translated really well into the DMS major, which has a lot of project based elements, and real word influences.

	<h2>College Life</h2><hr>

	<p>
		I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, studying to get my BA in Digital Media Studies. As I progress through this major, it's exciting to be able to move beyond the introductory courses and choose others that are unique to the topics that I am interested in. This semester I will be taking The Art of Film and Modern Architecture, both of which are subjects that are very new to me, but I am eager to learn more about. I am also continuing this CSC web development series, after taking CSC 170 last spring, and although I do not intend on pursuing computer science as a career, I think the fundamental skills learned are invaluable as the world becomes more digitized and driven by technology.

	<h2>Interests</h2><hr>
	<p>
		 When I first came to college, I started taking German, but after one semester I decided that it wasn't for me, and chose to switch back to Spanish, which I had taken in high school. I now have three courses left to fulfill the minor, including the one I am taking this fall, and I am hoping to finish the last one through a summer program in Ecuador. The program runs for four weeks, and consists of classes during the day, and various trips and excursions on the weekends. This trip seems like an excellent way to experience another culture, practice different language skills, and, as someone who has lived in Rochester her whole life, serve as a much needed change of scenery. To fulfill my social science cluster at UR, I've decided to follow a history track, which has consisted so far in classes about Western New York and the evolution of technology. Studying the origins and development of technology is an interesting contrast to most of the DMS courses, which direct more towards its present and future uses in society. For my natural science cluster, I am focusing on Environmental Science, which I believe is something that is very important to learn about, given how rapidly the world and its ecosystems are changing. The Environmental Science and Oceanography classes I took both focused on that a lot, and provided a lot of information about the effects that our actions have on the planet.
