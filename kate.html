	<h2>Early Life & Journey College<h2><hr>

	<p>
		I was born in Rochester, NY and have lived here pretty much her whole life.The elementary school that I went to was expeditionary learning based, which I think helped me to value practical and hands-on education from a young age. My high school was fortunate enough to have arts based majors for the students, and there I studied Theater Technology, which continued the same opportunities of physical learning. Included in that were some classes for lighting and sound design, CAD programming, and PhotoShop skills. I think these experiences have all translated really well into the DMS major, which has a lot of project based elements, and real word influences.

	<h2>College Life</h2><br>

	<p>
		I am currently a junior at the University of Rochester, studying to get my BA in Digital Media Studies. As I progress through this major, it's exciting to be able to move beyond the introductory courses and choose others that are unique to the topics that I am interested in. This semester I will be taking The Art of Film and Modern Architecture, both of which are subjects that are very new to me, but I am eager to learn more about. I am also continuing this CSC web development series, after taking CSC 170 last spring, and although I do not intend on pursuing computer science as a career, I think the fundamental skills learned are invaluable as the world becomes more digitized and driven by technology.
