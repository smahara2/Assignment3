	<h2>Early Life<h2><br>
		
	<p>
		I was born in Rochester, NY and have lived here pretty much her whole life.The elementary school that I went to was expeditionary learning based, which I think helped me to value practical and hands-on education from a young age. My high school was fortunate enough to have arts based majors for the students, and there I studied Theater Technology, which continued the same opportunities of physical learning. Included in that were some classes for lighting and sound design, CAD programming, and PhotoShop skills. I think these experiences have all translated really well into the DMS major, which has a lot of project based elements, and real word influences.
